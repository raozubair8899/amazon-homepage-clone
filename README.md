# Amazon-Homepage-Clone-HTML5-CSS3

A responsive clone of the **Amazon** homepage built with **HTML5** and **CSS3** (vanilla CSS, no frameworks).  

This project recreates the classic Amazon layout including the navigation bar, search functionality, hero banner, product category grid, and footer — perfect for practicing real-world UI replication, flexbox, responsive design, and hover effects.
